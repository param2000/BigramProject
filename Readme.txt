The bigram generation can be called by
    bigram.py
The bigram tests can be run by the bigramTests.py

**Histogram**
The program also generates a visual representation of histogram and dependency must be installed
I am using pip installer to install libraries
    -- pip install matplotlib

if you don't want to install the visual matplotlib library please comment line 59 in bigram.py (plot_histogram(counts))

**Special care was given to not reinvent the wheel :-), so utilizing libraries was prioritized**
